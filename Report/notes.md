1)  Mention each of the success criteria in the evaluation
    - copy and paste the success criteria into the evaluation
    and then reference back to the testing where each one was
    shown to be successful or not.

2)  Rename data dictionary to estimating memory requirements.

3)  Mention that it is unlikely that user input will break
    program from command line input because of the way
    I have designed it to take minimal input and limit
    what the user can access from entering arguments.

4)  Revise the diagrams so that the arrows make sense
    as to where they are going.
