System Analysis (Requirements):
===============================

Read the task, consider the project and identify the essential
requirements.

Give each requirement a number and list them in a table such as shown
below.

  **Number**   **Requirement**
  ------------ -----------------
  1            
  2            
  3

Design
======

This checklist only forms part of your possible design process, you may
need to cover Networking, SQL, or complex User Interfaces. The boxes
below form a guide of the minimum requirements that you must complete.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------
  I have included a full code listing in my report                                                                                                           
  I have used meaningful identifier names (1-3 marks)                                                                                                        
  I have used appropriate indentation (1-3 marks)                                                                                                            
  I have commented my code to explain what each part does (1-3 marks)                                                                                        
  I have used constants appropriately where needed (4-6 marks)                                                                                               
  I have used a consistent style throughout my code (4-6 marks)                                                                                              
  I have used subroutines (modularisation) within my code (7-9 marks)                                                                                        
  I have made appropriate use of local variables within subroutines (7-9 marks)                                                                              
  I have only used global variables if necessary (7-9 marks)                                                                                                 
  I have used validation wherever the user is expected to input data (7-9 marks)                                                                             
  I have used exception handling to avoid program errors (10-12 marks)                                                                                       
  My code is self-documenting because sensible variable names have always been used and comments have always been used to explain every part (10-12 marks)   
  I have used interfaces (passing parameters) for subroutines (13-15 marks)                                                                                  
  My subroutines perform one function each (cohesive) and are reused where appropriate (13-15 marks)

  My evidence includes input and output data                                               
  I have identified any failed tests (you should try to make sure you have at least one)
